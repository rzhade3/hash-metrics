# hash-metrics

This repository contains a script that can be run to automatically determine the best possible hashing options you can set on your application. 

Given that the average amount of compute power changes each year, this repository can help you to identify what the best new configuration options are for your app.

Currently contains implementations for:

* pbkdf2_sha256
* pbkdf2_sha512
* bcrypt

Will soon contain implementations for:

* scrypt
* argon2
