# hash-metrics

This PR automatically runs BCrypt and other hashing algorithms with modern architecture to benchmark them and provide minimum work factor recommendations for each algorithm. 

Given that the average amount of compute power changes each year, this repository will provide an up to date benchmark for each algorithm.
